The city of babylon was a richest city of its time. People from across the world would come to see the wealth of Babylon.

One day, the king of babylon was discussing about the wealth of his city with Prime Minister. They both realised that entire wealth of babylon is accumulated by a few rich people of the city. 

This thought made the king think, why and how only few people of his city are wealthy while all the other are still poor. He asked Prime Minister to call the richest man in babylon. 

The next day, prime minister invited the richest man of babylon {archaid}. Archaid was a humble wealthy person. 

King asked "Are you the richest man of babylon?". "Yes" replied Archaid.

"How did you accumulate so much wealth? Can you teach this to all the babylonians, So they also become wealthy like you?" asked the King.

"Ofcouse, my king" replied Archaid. "Give me 100 Students from our city and I will teach them my secret of becoming wealthy".
